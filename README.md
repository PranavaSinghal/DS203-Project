Data Science course project - Sustainability and Utilisation of Energy Sources 

The entire project code is located in the jupyter notebook. In order to install dependencies with conda to run this notebook use the environment YAML file as follows

In your terminal/ ananconda prompt type
~~~
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geo_env

Some of the key plots generated in the notebook can also be found in the [images](./images) folder
 
The data can be found in the [data](./data) folder. Energy data is taken from [BP Statistics](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html) and GDP and HDI data is taken from [UNDP](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506)
 
In order to visualise data on the world map, we have used a [shapefile](./Shape%20file/World_Countries.shp)
